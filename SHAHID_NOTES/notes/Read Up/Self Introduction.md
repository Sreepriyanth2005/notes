	
Hello, I’m Shahidkhan S from Kumbakonam, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Kongu Engineering College, Perundurai. I completed my schooling at Christ the King Matric Hr. Sec. School, securing 70.6% in SSLC and 86% in HSC. I have gained practical exposure as a Software Trainee Intern at Centillion Labs, where I focused on web scraping to generate input data for a Large Language Model (LLM). My technical skill set includes Java, C, JavaScript, and MongoDB, along with foundational experience in frameworks like Flask, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. I hold a certification as a MongoDB Associate Developer. I have worked on impactful projects such as a Multilingual Hate Speech Detection system for Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam using both text and speech inputs, and an Energy Management System integrated with Machine Learning that won first prize in a 30-hour KEC Hackathon. I also developed an AI-powered chatbot for an e-commerce platform, Farm2Bag, enabling users to manage orders and track status through conversational interaction. Additionally, I was awarded first prize in a departmental paper presentation for my project titled “Automatic AI Solar Panel.” I’m passionate about building intelligent, data-driven solutions, and my key areas of interest are Database Management Systems and Machine Learning. I consider time management and problem-solving skills to be my core strengths. One area I’m actively working to improve is my confidence in public speaking and presentation skills, especially in larger forums. My short-term goal is to join an innovative startUp where I can contribute and grow, and my long-term goal is to take on leadership responsibilities and drive impactful projects within the organization.
